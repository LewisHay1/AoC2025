# AoC2025
Advent of Code 2025 solutions written in multiple languages

## Structure
Solutions are split into directories based on their language i.e. C#, Java, etc.

Days are not split into separate Part One and Part Two files but can still always be run separately by calling `DayX.PartY()` or similar.

Input files are not included due to guidelines.
